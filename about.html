            Hey there!</h3>
            <p>I feel like this would be the best place to go over both my professional life as well as a bit of my personal life. As far as my professional-side, I am a Developer who specializes in User Interface Design with experience in app desigm, web design, and web development. My background was initially in graphic design and sound engineering for various companies such as VisArts in Rockville, Live In Genesis Podcast, and as an independent contractor. I also dabbled greatly into other languages such as Python and Java during my spare time and decided I wanted a bit of both worlds by focusing on my strengths as a professional developer and designer in 2021 and ultimately becoming a UI Developer. So far, the journey has been a great one and I plan to continue growing in my field everyday!
        </p>
        <p>
            I am fueled by my passion for understanding the process of vvisual hierarchy, data design, and color theory. I am always eager to learn the foundations of what makes the digial atmosphere a blissfull & useful experience by staying in tune with the latest UI strategies, tips, and tricks through continues coursework and professional development. Plus, I have loads of fun playing around with code while being able to ustelize my imagination.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a nutshell, my goal is to simply turn boring things into something visually beautiful!
        </p>
        <p>Now, more on the personal side of things... I guess I'll start by saying that I am constantly motivated by the endless possibilities the digital world has to offer. I think it's safe to say that no one knows what technology would look like 20 years from now, but I will say that I will still be a student of all the vast knowledge out there for me to utelize in order to be the best at what I do! Ever since I was a child, I have been super competitive and at the same time, carefree. This gave me the freedom to make incredibly <b>BOLD</b> decisions directed in creating real change. My life has been a terrifying, but fruitful journey and I can't wait to show the world what I can offer.</p>
        <p>
            There is so much I would like to share with you, but I feel like it would be best to do this at a steady pace. No one appreciates information-overload. So, I will be blogging during my spare time about my journey as a UI devloper, but also my passions, goals, and desire for positive change....one step. at. a. time. 
        </p>
